# PhD
Since 2017 I have worked with the topic of carbon footprint. My doctoral dissertation dealt with the problem of using convolutional neural networks for whole life carbon footprint estimation in early design phases. During my research I have created a Grasshopper plugin that has been using Machine Learning for carbon footprint estimation out of simplified Rhinoceros3d model using Python. The doctoral dissertation has been defended in May 2022 with distinction (the dissertation has been prepared in polish and is available online:
